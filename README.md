#OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT 
PROJECT NAME: STUDENT GRADE TRACKER

Objective:
    The primary objective of this project is to create a simple Python program that calculates the average grade and corresponding letter grade for a student based on the grades received in various subjects. The program is designed to accept user input for the number of subjects, the names of the subjects, and the grades for each subject, and then produce a grade report.

Key Points:
1)User Input: The program interacts with the user to collect data about subjects and grades.
2)Average Grade Calculation: It computes the average grade of the entered grades.
3)Letter Grade Assignment: It assigns a letter grade based on the calculated average grade.
4)Grade Report Generation: The program outputs a formatted grade report listing each subject with its grade, the overall average grade, and the letter grade.

Roles and Responsibilities:
role:- Developer:
Implement the functions to calculate the average grade ("calculate_average_grade").
Implement the function to determine the letter grade from the average ("calculate_letter_grade").
Create the main script to handle user input, process data, and generate the output report ("main").

Key Insights:
1)Modularity: The program is structured into distinct functions, promoting modularity and reusability. This design simplifies debugging and enhances code readability.
2)User Interaction: Collecting user inputs for subjects and grades makes the program dynamic and adaptable to different user needs.
3)Grade Calculation Logic: The grading logic is straightforward, following conventional grading scales, which makes the program easy to understand and use.
4)Output Formatting: The program ensures the output is well-formatted and easy to interpret, which improves the user experience.


Result:

The project successfully achieves its objective by enabling users to input their grades, compute the average, and obtain a corresponding letter grade. Upon execution, the user is prompted to enter the number of subjects, the names of each subject, and the grades. The program then calculates and displays the average grade along with the letter grade, providing a clear and concise grade report. This tool can be useful for students to quickly assess their academic performance across different subjects.
